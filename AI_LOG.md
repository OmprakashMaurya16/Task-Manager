# AI_LOG

AI tools were used during development in the following ways:

## ChatGPT

- Assistance with JWT middleware improvements
- RBAC logic refinement
- Error handling improvements
- Sorting and filtering design review
- Code refactoring suggestions

## Claude

- Architecture review and folder structure feedback
- Security trade-off discussions

## Stitch

- Initial UI scaffolding for forms and layout components

All AI-generated outputs were reviewed, modified, and tested before integration.

I ensured full understanding of:

- JWT flow
- RBAC enforcement
- Database schema design
- API logic
- React state management
